# In this repository we carry out the 0x09-static_libraries exercises.

## It has the following tasks

- Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below, If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

- Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

- Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:

Why use libraries
How they work
